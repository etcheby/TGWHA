# Authentication
In this example I'm using local credentials file in the provider.tf file. Change path to local credentials file accordingly as well as desired region. It's a best practice not to hardcode your AWS credentials in your script - Other Authentication options for the AWS Provider can be found under the Authentication Section of Terraform AWS Provider Documentation.
